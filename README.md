# Overview

This program was created to demostrate my learning of Java; namely the use and syntax for functions, variables, conditionals, and loops.

I wrote this Tic-Tac-Toe game because it easily uses functions, variables, conditionals and loops while having a result that is both fun and familar.

Tic-Tac-Toe
The game has two players 'X' and 'O' who take turns selecting an area to place their marker ('X' or 'O' respectively). The first one to get three in-a-row wins. If all spots are taken without someone getting three in-a-row, the game is a

Imports in my program:
Java.util.Arrays
- used to manipulate the array for the tic tac toe board
Java.util.Scanner
- used for user input

# Future Work

- I would like to see if there is a more efficent way to check for a winner. Rather than hard coding each winning scenerio.
- I would like to learn more about Java.util.Scanner and just Java.util in general. I used it according to instruction and trial and error, but wouldn't say I'm an expert in the slightest. 
- I think it would be fun to have a second game mode. This could be triggered if you reach a 'draw' you could choose to start a new game or continue the game you are on. If you choose to continue you would be able to overwrite the markers someone else's or your own until you get a winner.
